1. Make sure all entries start with a ^./ otherwise you might end up excluding files you did not intend to. 
Using the ^./ makes the exclude start from / and look for your path.
Ex.
^./myfiles/
^./mytrash/

2. Do not use wildcards. They tend to exclude everything on the system.

3. Excluding files does NOT mean that you are excluding a filesystem. If you have a 200gig filesystem called /backups and you add that to 
your exclude list :
^./backups
All you’ve done is exclude all of the data in that filesystem. If you restore that mksysb, the /backups filesystem will still be recreated at 200gig,
but it will be empty. The best way to exclude a filesystem from a mksysb backup, will be to unmount the filesystem before running your mksysb.
Alternatively you can put your filesystem entry in the /etc/exclude.rootvg and
edit the image.data and remove the entries for the lv and fs but be VERY careful. You can easily corrupt this file.
